## Working with the repository

- The latest changes are in the `master` branch. The version there is always a SNAPSHOT version. If you want to use it, clone the git repository, there is no SNAPSHOT repository.
- Release versions are committed to the `releases` branch. Whenever something is pushed to this branch, a release is built and pushed to Bintray (given that the new version in pom.xml is valid)
